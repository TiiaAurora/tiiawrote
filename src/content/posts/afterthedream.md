## After the Dream

My breath hangs in clouds<br>
as I crunch through morning frost.<br>
Your hand grips mine<br>
a bundle of warmth, an anchor<br>
in the brittle air.<br>

<br>

I rest my head against your sleeve,<br>
smell wool and wintergreen.<br>
Your lips graze my temple,<br>
and for a moment, the cold<br>
forgets to bite.<br>

<br>

“You know,” you say,<br>
“This feels like a dream.”<br>
I look up, snowflakes<br>
catching in my lashes<br>
“Why’s that?”<br>

<br>

Your laugh puffs white,<br>
a joke only you understand,<br>
before your mouth finds<br>
mine,<br>
soft as a secret.<br>

<br>

Then<br>
your fingers slip.<br>
Sudden cold floods the space<br>
where your palm had been.<br>
I turn, but the path is empty<br>
only my own footprints,<br>
In the snow.<br>

<br>

The dream stays sharp as pine needles.<br>
Real as the sting in my lungs.<br>
But the streetlamps flicker off,<br>
and somewhere, an alarm clock barks.<br>
<br><br>
