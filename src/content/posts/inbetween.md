## In Between

I am sitting here,<br>
Feeling like half a person.<br>
Can only express half my truth.<br>
I chose to, but I don’t like it.<br>
<br>
I am scared that the full truth,<br>
Will be the end.<br>
And so half of me enjoys this dream,<br>
The other half whispers,<br>
words that sound like the truth.<br>
Could be a lie.<br>
Could be a fear.<br>
Either way they strangle me.<br>
<br>
How long can I be without oxygen?<br>
I ask myself. <br>
How long can I endure this?<br>
I know the answer.<br>
The fear so big I’d rather<br>
Suffocate myself<br>
Than face my truth. <br>
<br><br>
