## Behind The Glass

</br>
You see a sketch of me,</br>
outlined in colors you want,</br>
not the mosaic beneath.</br>
</br>
My scars could map symphonies,</br>
my thoughts dissolve constellations,</br>
Yet you praise the frame and not the fire.</br>
</br>
The greatest gift I can offer?</br>
PRESENCE. To cradle your words</br>
like heirlooms held close to my heart.</br>
But you trade truth for trinkets,</br>
mistake skin for sanctuary.</br>
</br>
Tell me,</br>
When you whisper, "Beautiful,"</br>
do you taste the blood</br>
of all I survived?</br>
When you claim to adore,</br>
can you quote the verses</br>
that cracked my ribs wide open</br>
to let the dawn in?</br>
</br></br>
