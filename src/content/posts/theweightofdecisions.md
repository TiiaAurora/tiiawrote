## The Weight of Decisions

Augur you have seen the past and the future.<br/>
Why didn't you share your secrets?<br/>
Why didn't you warn me when danger was near?<br/>
Why did you stop talking to me?<br/>

When the world burnt, when the smoke covered the sky,<br/>
You stood there in disbelief with tears in your eyes.<br/>
You knew it had to be done.<br/>
You knew there was no other way.<br/>

The transition was needed.<br/>
The old had to go as it was flawed, broken, and miserable.<br/>
The new is here but now its incomplete.<br/>
The transition was inevitable.<br/>

The nights are dark and silent,<br/>
All pictures filled with distorted faces of the past.<br/>
My memories covered with a black veil,<br/>
Your name burnt in my mind and the loss - a void never filled.<br/>
