### Summer rain<br>

<br>
Summer rain surprised us; a sudden hush,<br>
a laugh, a sprint to the apple tree's thin shade,<br>
where the tree's arms trembled, offering barely enough<br>
to keep the downpour off your shoulders as I sought warmth. <br>
<br>
Our faces close, anticipation mirrored in our eyes<br>
“Cold?” you asked, though spring still warmed the ground<br>
you drew me near. Through the leaves, light traces<br>
an innocent dance of shadows on your cheek.<br>
<br>
“What if this storm outlasts us?” <br>
“Then let it,” I said, my lips touching yours.<br>
Your jacket, faintly damp against the closing space,<br>
nothing mattered while the world blurred to a foggy haze. <br>
<br><br>
