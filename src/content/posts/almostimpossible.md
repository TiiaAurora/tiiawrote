## Almost Impossible<br>

It's almost impossible<br>
to see someone for who they are,<br>
for most wear borrowed faces,<br>
mimicking who they wish to be<br>
to impress those who barely notice.<br><br>

Finding a true spirit,<br>
loyal to its own nature,<br>
feels like chasing a ghost—<br>
someone brave enough<br>
to stand alone,<br>
unmoved by the need to belong.<br><br>

And as you wake each morning<br>
for the job that drains your soul,<br>
for the life that barely holds together,<br>
you start to wonder—<br>
do you even know yourself?<br><br>

Freedom is the most terrifying<br>
and beautiful thing at once.<br>
It can build you up<br>
or tear you apart—<br>
the choice is entirely yours.<br><br>

Yet to see someone as they are<br>
remains almost impossible.<br>
For in your eyes,<br>
they will always be<br>
the reflection of your own expectations,<br>
nothing more.<br>
<br><br>
