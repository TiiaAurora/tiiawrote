## The Twins

Clouds in the sky<br/>
the lightning devours<br/>
A tree is in flames<br/>
Screams echo afar<br/>

Her hands red, <br/>
skin peeling,<br/>
Blisters that grow<br/>
and a smile on her face<br/>

Drop, Drop, Drop...,<br/>
Aurora, the sky is on fire,<br/>
Drop, Drop, Drop...,<br/>
The landscape is charred<br/>

Her head tilts<br/>
the smile fades<br/>
Her eyes pierce the smoke<br/>

A pain in my head<br/>

"This world is not yours<br/>
nor is it mine. <br/>
The flame may consume<br/>
but never be confined"<br/>

Her hair catches fire<br/>
Drop, Drop, Drop...,<br/>
Her chest torn apart<br/>
Drop, Drop, Drop...,<br/>

The ground - a black puddle, <br/>
seeps into the dirt<br/>
Aurora your hair is on fire<br/>
I want you to stay<br/>

And so she will dance<br/>
from ember to ember<br/>
The ashes fall down<br/>
She taints the December <br/>
