## Elegy for What Never Bloomed

With every new day,<br>
the world in my dream fades.<br>
I reach out, "please stay",<br>
but I know it's too late.<br>

The things that could be<br>
are only a ghost,<br>
a shadow maybe,<br>
of all that is lost.<br>

I took off the ring,<br>
worn, scratched, and bent,<br>
and felt the sharp sting<br>
of a vision's cold end.<br>

Forever was neverâ€”<br>
how foolish was I?<br>
Did I think I was clever,<br>
or simply too blind?<br>

It's quiet now,<br>
as the chapter is closed.<br>
No if's and no how's,<br>
just a heart decomposed.<br>

And as the world stopped turning,<br>
my soul turned to stone.<br>
When the forests were burning,<br>
I lost all I'd known.<br>
