## Wanderer

The valley dark and shadows dance<br/>
A wan'drer and tormented soul<br/>
Beneath the moons' cold ghostly trance<br/>
seeks solace where the spirits toll<br/>

In whispers of the ice cold wind<br/>
Regret and sorrow deep within<br/>
He hears the cries of guilt so grim<br/>
His heart's lament, a nonstop din<br/>

A curse upon his foolish head<br/>
He roams the night in search of peace<br/>
By past misdeeds forever dread<br/>
From torment that will never cease<br/>

Though seeking calm, he finds no rest<br/>
No piece to find in nights embrace<br/>
In shadows deep his soul abcessed<br/>
Eternal pain is fate to face<br/>
