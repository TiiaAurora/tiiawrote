## Winter

Snowflakes dancing in the wind<br>
The winter cold the skies deep blue<br>
A blues that gives my thoughts a tint<br>
So thoughtful wondering what's true<br>

A bird that seeks its shelter warmth<br>
Will warm my heart - I can relate<br>
But late I noticed my own harm<br>
A harmless wish for home I crave<br>

And as the sun sets in the west<br>
I wonder what the cloud may think<br>
If clouds seek closure seek the rest<br>
And wonder why the sun did sink<br>

But that is silly, clouds don’t think<br>
The sun just travels, does not sink<br>
The birds just fly they aren’t lost<br>
And snowflakes are just pretty frost. <br>
<br><br>
