## And They Danced

Two broken souls, </br>
briefly met - briefly lost </br>
Time was not kind - the damage was done </br>
so they danced, </br>
not knowing why, </br>
around each other. </br>
It felt easy - it felt home, </br>
the most natural thing. </br>
The rounds they danced, </br>
some closer, some further, </br>
but always with good intent. </br>
When will they realize, </br>
that this is what it's about? </br>
This is the purpose. </br>
This is healing. </br>
