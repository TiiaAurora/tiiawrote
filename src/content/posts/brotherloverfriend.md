## My brother, my lover, my friend<br><br>

My brother,<br>
I called upon you<br>
I sought out your soul<br>
In the blinding darkness of nothingness<br><br>
My lover,<br>
Your traces have been faint.<br>
And everywhere is your essence<br>
I follow it with a primal instinct<br><br>
My friend,<br>
No thought was lost<br>
Everything written down.<br>
We shall talk soon.<br><br>
Another round was made<br>
Time flies<br>
The darkness is back<br>
My brother, my lover, my friend<br>
We are far apart<br><br>
and<br>
it feels like galaxies.<br>
It feels like eons<br>
It feels like different realities<br><br>
Another round<br>
The darkness now strangles me<br>
My determination weakens<br>
Are you even looking for me?<br><br>
My brother, my lover, my friend<br>
I am stranded without you.<br>
I am stranded.<br>
Without you.<br>
<br><br>
