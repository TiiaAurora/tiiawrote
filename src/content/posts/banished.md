## Banished

Banished - How many times?<br>
Does it matter?<br>
A human body to keep you weak<br>
A human brain to keep you contemplating<br>
But your soul? Oh, it remembers.<br>
And it tells you who you are<br>
Every. Single. Minute. Second. Tak.. Tak.. Tak..<br>
It teases you in those troubled peaceful nights<br>
Laughs at you quietly<br>
When you see fire<br>
You're like a domesticated dog<br>
that smelled raw flesh for the first time<br>
Instincts awake<br>
_Snap_ - Come back human! <br>
Be a good boy. <br>
Banished and chosen to keep it that way. <br>
Good boy. <br>
