Since I was a little child, I've had a deep love for writing poems. The classics have always been a source of inspiration for me, drawing me into their timeless beauty. Poetry offers the best way for me to express my emotions, allowing me to convey feelings and thoughts that are often hard to put into words directly. It's a unique form of communication. Saying things without explicitly saying them where each verse becomes a window to the soul, capturing the essence of what I truly feel.

After taking a long break, I've realized how much I miss the joy that poetry brings me. Writing poems makes me happy, even the sad ones.
