## The Outsider

In shadowed halls, I wandered still,<br/>
Through ancient stones feel cold and gray,<br/>
A nameless fear, horrendous chill,<br/>
Where sunless worlds kept light at bay.<br/>

From spidercombs, I yearned to rise,<br/>
To grasp a life I don't recall,<br/>
Beneath a veil of hidden skies,<br/>
The tower stood demonic tall.<br/>

A mirror's face, a twisted ghoul,<br/>
Revealed the truth I could not see,<br/>
An outcast born I was a fool,<br/>
No mortal place, no destiny.<br/>

With anguish deep, my soul did weep,<br/>
For cursed existence, fraught with pain,<br/>
In shadows dark, forever creep,<br/>
A wretched life, in vain, in vain.<br/>
