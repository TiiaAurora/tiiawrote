## Silly Game

Have you ever put your hand<br>
close to the flame of a candle<br>
to see how long you can<br>
withstand the heat? The pain? <br>
Then you pulled it back<br>
rubbed your fingers and laughed<br>

The fingers hurt just for a second<br>
the memory lasts forever - you learned<br>
Sometimes when you feel silly<br>
you try it again - see if you<br>
last longer - same results<br>

What a silly game. <br>
Because the flame won't change. <br>

This is how I love - Such a silly game. <br>
<br><br>
