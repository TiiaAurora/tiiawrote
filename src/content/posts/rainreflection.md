## Rain Reflections

As the clouds drift slowly past the moon,<br/>
I cannot help but think:<br/>
this might be the most beautiful night<br/>
of all the nights I have ever seen.<br/>

The heavy scent of rain surrounds me,<br/>
while the sidewalk sparkles with a thousand reflections<br/>
of the street lanterns on the pavement,<br/>
under my feet like black crystals.<br/>

I hear raindrops dripping from the roofs,<br/>
a chaotic melody of<br/>
happiness and melancholy,<br/>
both in my heart as I listen to their song.<br/>

The stars above me resemble the ground below.<br/>
The universe is watching, observing,<br/>
never judging, because who am I<br/>
to win its attention in the first place?<br/>

Sunken in thoughts and swallowed by memories,<br/>
some long gone,<br/>
some that never were,<br/>
some I long for when I close my eyes.<br/>

The air is humid and cold<br/>
as it flows past my face,<br/>
crawling along my neck before it finally leaves me,<br/>
setting off on its own long journey.<br/>

The scent of my perfume is carried away with it,<br/>
singing a song of lilies and roses<br/>
to the next person<br/>
or to no one.<br/>
