## Just Me

Emotions should not be contained;<br/>
They should be shared.<br/>
Tears should not be held back;<br/>
They should flow like rivers of relief.<br/>

My heart is like thermite,<br/>
Once ignited, it burns<br/>
with an uncontrollable fire,<br/>
consuming everything in its path.<br/>
And I love myself for that.<br/>

My brain is a perpetuum mobile,<br/>
Once inspired, I cannot find sleep.<br/>
A relentless engine of thoughts,<br/>
a catalyst of creativity,<br/>
all in harmony with my burning heart.<br/>

I wouldn't want it any other way.<br/>
The moment you see my eyes<br/>
without passion, without curiosity,<br/>
you'll know I've died.<br/>
<br><br>
