I fell in love with lonely stars<br/>
I reach my hand toward the sky<br/>
Their light is guiding me afar<br/>
To touch the dreams that drift on high<br/>

Between my hand and stars a distance<br/>
I laugh and walk towards the tree<br/>
A space just filled with tears - persistence<br/>
To find a buried mystery<br/>

Letters hidden in the stem<br/>
But not to me to someone else<br/>
Written words of love in them<br/>
A gentle thought of love itself<br/>

Should I take or should I leave<br/>
The night is young the air is warm<br/>
Between the heart and mind, I grieve<br/>
The perfect moment, we transform<br/>

To stellar lights that guide and share<br/>
The constellations known, unknown<br/>
We leave behind our earthly care. <br/>
Through galaxies we've never flown.<br/>
