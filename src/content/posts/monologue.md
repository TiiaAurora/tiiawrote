## Monologue

I close my eyes and close the book<br>
The head has thought, the ink has dried<br>
About the things that are, that might<br>
The wonders I for granted I took<br>

A voice that tells me to think straight<br>
A pain that tells me to move on<br>
A thought of hope that was quick gone<br>
A dream that felt so real, so great<br>

Let’s be no fool just for a while<br>
Your heart is pure, that I agree<br>
To happiness that's not the key <br>
You’re honestly just thoughts, no smile<br>

Your landmarks are less than impressive<br>
Your name has no sweet ring to it<br>
You fear the life with every bit<br>
You paint dark pictures too obsessive<br>

You challenge everything that's true<br>
Forgot to know where is your place<br>
And have you even seen your face? <br>
The things you put your people through. <br>

You know I don’t mean to be rude<br>
But honesty you do deserve<br>
You get on everybody's nerve<br>
Your closest friends it does include. <br>

“You see”, I slowly speak out loud<br>
“The things you say, just make me - Me”<br>
“I am no masterpiece, agreed<br>
But don’t you think that makes me proud?” <br>

“I am my little piece of art<br>
With scratches, tears <br>
and hopes and fears<br>
But this is how good stories start” <br>
