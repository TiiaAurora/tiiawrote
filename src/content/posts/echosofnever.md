## The Echos of Never

I woke up this morning,<br>
the taste of sweet honey in my mouth,<br>
stardust still in my hair,<br>
the warm touch of the sun on my skin.<br>
<br>
Laughter, giggles, and soft-spoken words<br>
echo around my head like moths around a candle,<br>
going silent one by one as they touch the flame.<br>
I take a deep breath and focus on my heartbeat.<br>
<br>
A close, familiar hand still holding on to me,<br>
I feel the pressure of every finger entwined with mine,<br>
twitching, slowly letting go, then suddenly gone,<br>
as if it never was here in the first place.<br>
<br>
A cold breeze comes through the window,<br>
touching my shoulders exposed by my covers.<br>
But even as I pull my blanket up,<br>
it doesn't compare to the warmth that was here mere minutes ago.<br>
<br>
The warm sun, that made my hair glow,<br>
as I looked into your eyes and only we existed.<br>
But when I opened my eyes, the picture was different,<br>
the cold, bare white walls staring at me like ghosts from the past.<br>
<br>
And as I get out of bed and my naked feet touch the cold floor,<br>
as the cold air makes me shiver,<br>
and as the traffic noise from outside competes with my thoughts,<br>
I realize I am homesick for a world that never existed.<br>
<br><br>
