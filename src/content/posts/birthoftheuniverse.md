## The Birth of the Universe<br>

Today my heart birthed a star<br>
small, bright, trembling with new light,<br>
its dance wild as a heartbeat.<br>
I grew chaos within my bones,<br>
weary, yes, but tearful with wonder<br>
before letting you go - softly<br>
into the night’s wide cradle.<br>
<br>
My hands released you<br>
the moment your fire outgrew my sky.<br>
See my face? All pride, no sorrow.<br>
You left a sacred hollow here<br>
a womb-scar where the universe<br>
first learned your name.<br>
<br>
Now love, you’ll blaze your own<br>
constellations. Carve daylight<br>
from the dark. I’ll linger here,<br>
half-alive, half-stardust, smiling<br>
as you pull planets into orbit<br>
your gentle light rewriting<br>
all my old, familiar heavens.<br>
<br>
Rest finds me now. I’m quiet.<br>
Full. My eyes close, not in ending,<br>
but to see you clearer:<br>
there; your first flawless arc,<br>
proud and silver, stitching eternity<br>
to the breast of everything.<br>
Where my sky ends, yours begins.<br>
<br><br>
