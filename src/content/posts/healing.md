## Healing

When the rain fell<br/>
_I didn’t say anything_<br/>

When it snowed<br/>
_I didn’t say anything_<br/>

When the flowers bloomed<br/>
_I didn’t say anything_<br/>

When the air was hot and humid<br/>
_I didn’t say anything_<br/>

When the leaves turned their color a second time, <br/>
_I cried_<br/>

When the snow covered everything with a white blanket and silence<br/>
_I screamed_<br/>

When the flowers poked their little heads out of the ground and the air smelled like sweet honey and dreams.<br/>
_I raged_<br/>

And in summer when the warm night and the monotone song of the crickets turned into my music to keep me awake. <br/>
_I was at peace._ <br/>

The third autumn exploded in colors I didn’t remember. It was filled with words, music, pictures, laughter and the sound of dry leaves on the ground that crumbled with every step. <br/>
And I? <br/>
_I loved._ <br/>
<br><br>
