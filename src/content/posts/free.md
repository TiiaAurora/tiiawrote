## Free

Motionless, not a word<br>
Sitting in an empty room<br>
The walls white<br>
The floor cold<br><br>
Explosions in my head<br>
colorful, music, laughter, dancing<br>
Nuance and subtext.<br>
Flavors and scents.<br><br>
Motionless, not even showing an expression<br>
The face stares<br>
The eyes half closed, tired<br>
The body is aching.<br><br>
The ocean is singing<br>
I hear seagulls<br>
The waves crash into the cliff<br>
In the distance people are talking.<br>
Sounds that smell like freedom.<br><br>
Motionless taking a breath<br>
The explosions grow louder.<br>
The need to move almost unbearable<br>
But I won’t. I couldn’t<br><br>
A birthday song<br>
Clapping hands<br>
The smell of flowers<br>
A baby cries.<br><br>
Motionless I scream<br>
But no voice is heard<br>
My scream is internal<br>
But it is louder than the silence<br><br>
Quiet talking<br>
Someone crying<br>
A dog barks<br>
A door closes.<br><br>
Motionless I sit.<br>
For ten more years<br>
When suddenly the sun<br>
sparked through my window<br>
For the first time<br>
And as it touched my pale face<br>
As it traveled by<br>
I blink and lift my hand to cover my eyes<br>
not used to the light anymore.<br><br>
And for the first time<br>
It seems that life has chosen me<br>
So I get up,<br>
open the door,<br>
and leave.<br>
<br><br>
